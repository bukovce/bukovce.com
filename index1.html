<h2 style="background-color:powderblue;">What is a rubix cube?</h2>

<p>Rubik's cube is a puzzle in the shape of a cube , in the standard version 57 mm high. The cube is made up of 27 smaller parts, 
the visible sides of which are the faces of smaller cubes of 1/3 of the height of the cube itself. The central part without a 
visible surface consists of a system of axes around which the centers of the side surfaces can rotate. The remaining parts are
ingeniously shaped so that each face of the cube can rotate relative to the rest. This allows each corner piece and each 
side piece to change position with another corresponding piece. In the starting position, the six surfaces are evenly 
colored in the six colors white, red, orange, yellow, green and blue. The task is to rotate the faces in such a way 
that the cube is returned from any position to the starting position with smooth side faces.<mark>There are 43 252 003 274 489 856 000 combinations possible</mark></p>
